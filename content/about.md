## About Me

I'm a security professional specialising in penetration testing. I have a BSc Computer Forensics and Security and have worked for a number of large consultancies including BlackBerry Ltd and CGI UK Ltd. I've led engagements for large government departments through to satellite control systems and even on one occasion an aircraft carrier.  

Due to the varied work I've always had the need to learn new skills from exploit development through to architecture review. So one of the reasons I've set this site up is to share what I've learned and created with the industry.
