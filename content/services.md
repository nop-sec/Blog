After years of working for large multi national corporations providing services to corporate, government and military services I've decided to strike out on my own.
If your interested in acquiring the skills of a seasoned security professional then please don't hesitate to contact me. I can provide a range of services and am more than happy to have a chat whether you've had a recent penetration test and want a second opinion or expert advise or would like someone to help train your staff.

## Penetration Testing

+ Web Application
+ Internal Infrastructure
+ Thick Clients
+ Industrial Control System
+ Build Reviews and lock down Assessments
+ Source Code Reviews
+ Architecture Reviews
+ Security Advice
+ Reverse Engineering & Malware Analysis
+ Staff Training
