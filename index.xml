      <description>After years of working for large multi national corporations providing services to corporate, government and military services I&#39;ve decided to strike out on my own. If your interested in acquiring the skills of a seasoned security professional then please don&#39;t hesitate to contact me. I can provide a range of services and am more than happy to have a chat whether you&#39;ve had a recent penetration test and want a second opinion or expert advise or would like someone to help train your staff.</description>

      <description>About Me I&#39;m a security professional specialising in penetration testing. I have a BSc Computer Forensics and Security and have worked for a number of large consultancies including BlackBerry Ltd and CGI UK Ltd. I&#39;ve led engagements for large government departments through to satellite control systems and even on one occasion an aircraft carrier.
Due to the varied work I&#39;ve always had the need to learn new skills from exploit development through to architecture review.</description>
