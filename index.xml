      <description>About Me I&#39;m a security professional specialising in penetration testing. I have a BSc Computer Forensics and Security and have worked for a number of large consultancies including BlackBerry Ltd and CGI UK Ltd. I&#39;ve led engagements for large government departments through to satellite control systems and even on one occasion an aircraft carrier.
Due to the varied work I&#39;ve always had the need to learn new skills from exploit development through to architecture review.</description>
